#VideoCompressor App

A powerful and easy-to-use video compression library for android uses [MediaCodec](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodec) API. This library generates a compressed MP4 video with a modified width, height, and bitrate (the number of bits per
seconds that determines the video and audio files’ size and quality).



Then just call [VideoCompressor.start()] and pass context, uris, and saveAt directory name.

The method has a callback for 5 functions;
1) OnStart - called when compression started
2) OnSuccess - called when compression completed with no errors/exceptions
3) OnFailure - called when an exception occurred or video bitrate and size are below the minimum required for compression.
4) OnProgress - called with progress new value
5) OnCancelled - called when the job is cancelled
